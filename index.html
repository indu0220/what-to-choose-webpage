        <span style="color:aqua">THINGS TO CONSIDER WHILE DECIDING COLLEGE</span>
        <hr color="blue">
        <p>*Diversity - College is a time to learn about perspectives different from your own.<br>
            If a college has a homogenous student body or a student body that is exactly like you,<br>
            you’re not going to be challenged as much as you could be somewhere else.<br>
            *Internships - You can gain valuable experience as an intern during the academic year or summer.<br>
            Check out the college’s career office to learn if they offer resources to help students secure internships such as relationships with local companies. <br>
            *Tours Aren’t Everything - Every college looks amazing on a tour. But take some time to talk to real students.<br>
            Have they felt supported by the faculty and students at the university? What is the community like?<br>
            Will it be a place that sets you up for success?<br>
            *Speakers and Visiting Professors - Check out the speakers, visiting professors, and artists that have visited each college.<br>
            Does the university invite talented, exciting people to engage with its students?<br>
            *Extracurricular Activities - Check out the student organizations at each school to see what you might like to get involved in.<br>
            If you love playing soccer, but one school doesn’t have intramural tournaments, that could hugely impact your personal experience.</p>
